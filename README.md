# Technical Challenge

This repo contains a basic react-native app with 3 screens:

- Sign in
- Companies List
- Company Details

To get the project up and running, you will need to run `yarn` and `npx pod-install` (for iOS). You should then be able to run `yarn start` followed by `yarn ios` for iOS or `yarn android` for Android, assuming you have followed the instructions in the [react native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Troubleshooting

This project uses the latest version of react native, so if you are struggling to get the project to build, make sure you have followed all of the instructions in the [react native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

If you have trouble building on iOS via the cli, you may want to try building with XCode instead.
